# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to openplate are recorded here.

## 0.9.0 - 2026-09-03

- One account instead of a "sync" passphrase. The app now speaks in terms of
  an account and a password, not a technical sync passphrase.
- A blank device now opens on a welcome screen, not the onboarding
  questionnaire. Returning users get a clear way in before the app assumes
  they are new.
- A dedicated sign-in route. Signing in now happens on its own page, and it
  waits for the first data pull to finish before handing control back to the
  app, so a returning user never lands on an empty screen.
- Signing out remembers the last name used on this device and shows a
  "Not you?" link to clear it, instead of forgetting who was signed in.
- Skipping a join link now leads to sign-in, so someone who already has an
  account is not pushed into creating a new one.

## 0.8.3 and earlier

See the annotated git tags (`git tag -l -n1`) for the release notes of each
